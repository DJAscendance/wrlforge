# Open Source Provenance Policy

**Status:** current project policy. Supersedes the WD0-era
`docs/white-dune-2026/GPL_PROVENANCE_BOUNDARY.md`, which was written for WRL Forge's
former MIT posture and has been removed from `main` (Git history retains it).

> This is engineering provenance guidance, not legal advice. It records how WRL Forge
> tracks the origin and licensing of the code it ships. It is not a legal opinion and
> does not substitute for one.

---

## 1. Project license

Original WRL Forge code and documentation are licensed **`GPL-3.0-or-later`** unless a
file says otherwise. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for the canonical GNU GPL v3 text and
[`COPYRIGHT.md`](COPYRIGHT.md) for the copyright statement.

Third-party material incorporated into WRL Forge **retains its own copyright and
license**. The project license applies to WRL Forge's own work; it does not relicense
anyone else's.

The practical rule for anything you bring in:

> It must be license-compatible with distributing the combined program under
> `GPL-3.0-or-later`, and every required attribution, copyright line, and license
> notice must be preserved.

## 2. What is now permitted

Open-source implementation material — source, algorithms, data tables, fixtures — **may
be read, searched, studied, compared, adapted, translated, ported, and incorporated**
into WRL Forge when:

1. its license is compatible with `GPL-3.0-or-later` for the proposed combination; and
2. its provenance is recorded here (§4); and
3. its upstream copyright notices and license text are preserved in the tree and in the
   distributed artifact.

This is a genuine change of direction. The former clean-room prohibition existed only
because WRL Forge was MIT-licensed and could not absorb copyleft code. That constraint
is gone.

### 2.1 White Dune

**White Dune is permitted implementation material.** It is
[GPL-2.0-or-later](https://sourceforge.net/projects/white-dune/), which is compatible
with distributing a combined work under `GPL-3.0-or-later` (the "or later" election in
White Dune's own headers is what makes the upgrade lawful).

Two cautions that are engineering facts, not policy hedging:

- **Verify the license of the specific artifact you use.** Do not assume every White
  Dune file, version, or packaged binary carries identical license metadata. The
  1.930 source tree's headers say "version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
  later version"; a different file or a different release may not, and a `.deb` of
  binaries proves nothing about implementation licensing at all.
- **Record what you took.** Anything copied, adapted, or closely translated gets a §4
  entry and preserved upstream copyright headers. "Conceptually informed only" — you
  read it, then wrote your own — should still be recorded, because a reviewer cannot
  tell the difference from the diff alone.

Reuse is a **separate approved lane** from the licensing transition itself. No White
Dune material was imported as part of adopting the GPL.

### 2.2 Other open-source projects

The rule is general, not White-Dune-specific. FreeWRL, X3D toolkits, and any other
open-source VRML/X3D implementation are usable on the same terms: verify the license,
confirm compatibility, preserve notices, record provenance.

## 3. What remains prohibited

Changing WRL Forge's license did **not** widen what may be copied. Still forbidden:

- **Proprietary source** without explicit written permission.
- **Leaked source**, or source obtained in violation of a licence agreement, terms of
  service, NDA, or access control.
- **Software with no usable license** — "found on the internet", "no LICENSE file",
  abandonware whose rights holder is unknown.
- Code whose license is **GPL-incompatible for the proposed combination**.
- **Snippets of unestablished provenance** — a Stack Overflow answer, a gist, a pasted
  fragment whose origin cannot be traced.
- **Removing or falsifying attribution**, upstream copyright lines, or license headers.

Reverse-engineering research artifacts of proprietary tools (`RE-ARTIFACTS`,
`blaxxun-cs-RE`, and similar) remain **implementation-prohibited**. They are not
open-source material and a GPL project license does nothing to change that.

> **Provenance before convenience.** If you cannot establish where something came from
> and under what license, do not copy it into WRL Forge. An unprovable origin is a
> defect, not a detail.

## 4. Third-party provenance register

Every piece of third-party implementation material incorporated into WRL Forge is
recorded here with:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| Upstream project | name |
| Source | repository or download URL |
| Version | tag, release, or commit, where practical |
| Component | the upstream file(s) or module used |
| Authors | upstream copyright holders |
| License | SPDX identifier |
| Destination | the WRL Forge file(s) |
| Mode | `copied` · `adapted` · `translated` · `conceptually informed only` |
| Local changes | substantial modifications made |
| Notices | what must ship, and where it ships |

### Current entries

**None.** No third-party implementation code has been copied, adapted, or translated
into WRL Forge's own source. Everything under `src/`, `renderer/`, `main.js`,
`preload.js`, `validator.js`, and `scripts/` is original work.

Third-party components that WRL Forge **depends on and redistributes unmodified**
(x_ite, CodeMirror, Electron, and their bundled assets) are not implementation
derivations and are inventoried separately in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

### Standards data is not third-party code

`src/vrml/node-schema.js` is generated from two license-clean **fact** sources — the
ISO/IEC 14772-1 (VRML97) node reference and the MIT-licensed `x_ite.d.ts` type
declarations. It extracts names, types, access categories, and default literals; it
reproduces no standards prose and no implementation. That remains true and is asserted
by `test/vrml/node-schema.test.js`.

That test is a **provenance statement about that one generated file**, not a residue of
the old prohibition. If a future lane derives schema content from another source, the
test and this section change together.

### 4.1 Research & Reference

The register above records **incorporated implementation material**. This section records
something different and deliberately kept separate: external implementation sources that
were **deliberately studied** — for architecture, algorithms, UX/workflow, or
cross-checking — where **no source code has been copied, adapted, translated, or
incorporated**.

A record here is **not** a claim that any WRL Forge file became derivative. Reading a
GPL-compatible implementation does not make the reader's own independently written code a
derivative work, and this section must never be read as implying otherwise. It exists so
that a reviewer can see what was consulted and when, and so that a later port has an
honest starting point.

**Transition rule.** If code that was only studied later becomes **conceptually informed,
translated, or adapted** into WRL Forge, create or update the corresponding entry in the
§4 production register **at that time**, with the mode set accordingly. Moving between
the two sections is the normal, expected lifecycle — a Research & Reference record is a
provenance *lead*, not a permanent exemption from §4.

#### Current records

**WD-OSS-A1 — White Dune implementation & architecture audit**

| field | value |
|---|---|
| Project | **White Dune** (`wdune`) |
| Local source | 1.930 source evidence, `~/Projects/white-dune-archive/white_dune-1.930-source-evidence/` (outside every Git repository) |
| Upstream | `github.com/mufti11/white_dune`, commit **`62f9ab457004666143160909a7e348bf87c107e6`** (1.956, 2020-09-02) — last upstream commit; project dormant |
| License posture | White Dune-authored code is **`GPL-2.0-or-later`** (1,220 of 1,303 `src/` files), compatible with WRL Forge's `GPL-3.0-or-later` via the "or later" election. The tree also contains **separately licensed vendored third-party code** — BSD-3-Clause, MIT, LGPL, permissive — plus generated Bison/flex output and 17–18 files carrying **no grant at all**. Licensing is **not uniform**; verify per artifact. |
| Purpose | implementation and architecture audit, to decide the next WRL Forge lane |
| Resulting document | [`docs/white-dune-2026/WD_OSS_A1_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md`](docs/white-dune-2026/WD_OSS_A1_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md) |
| Code incorporated | **None.** No White Dune implementation code, fixture, example scene, or asset was copied, adapted, translated, vendored, submoduled, or committed. No file under `src/`, `renderer/`, `scripts/`, `main.js`, `preload.js` or `validator.js` was modified by the audit. |
| Status | research only; §4 register correctly still reads **None** |

**Reuse leads recorded by that audit** — none acted on, each requiring a §4 entry *before*
any code lands: White Dune's handle protocol and `Scene3DView::Handle3D` frame math
(adaptation candidates), and its command/undo model, `Proto` unified type descriptor, and
ROUTE/`IS` authoring UI (architecture/UX reference). Its **document core is rejected
outright** — a live object graph with full regeneration on write, incompatible with
WRL Forge's byte-preserving document invariant.

**If geometry algorithms are ever wanted**, take Poly2Tri (BSD-3-Clause), catmull-clark
(MIT) and FTGL (MIT) from **their own upstreams**, not through White Dune: better terms,
cleaner provenance, active maintenance. Those would be `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` entries.

## 5. Source headers

**Do not mass-add GPL boilerplate headers to existing files.** The root `LICENSE` plus
`package.json` metadata are sufficient for WRL Forge's original files, and a sweeping
header commit would bury real history under churn.

For **new** files, a single SPDX line is encouraged where it is unobtrusive:

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
```

For **third-party-derived** files, preserve the upstream copyright and license header
verbatim and add WRL Forge's own notice **alongside** it. Never replace an upstream
header with a WRL Forge one — that is exactly the falsified-attribution case §3 forbids.

## 6. Corpus and research boundaries

The spike harnesses under `spikes/` guard their corpus roots with hard path assertions
that **throw** rather than silently skip. Those guards are **corpus hygiene**, not
license policy: a VRML97 semantics sweep measures authored Cybertown content, and a
modeling tool's C++ source tree or a reverse-engineering artifact directory is not that.
The guards stay, and their rationale is unchanged by the license transition.

**A dedicated oracle reader is not an exemption.** A future lane may want to read named
White Dune files as a **cross-check oracle** (for example, comparing field-constraint
tables against the ISO mirror). That is permitted and needs **no change to any guard**,
because the two mechanisms never meet: a corpus guard rejects a *root offered to generic
enumeration*, whereas an oracle reader opens **explicitly named files by explicit path**
and never enumerates a corpus at all.

Such a reader must be: read-only · addressed by explicit path, never by discovery ·
**non-normative**, with every discrepancy adjudicated against ISO/IEC 14772-1 (§7) ·
recorded under §4.1 Research & Reference.

**Do not add a corpus-guard exemption to enable one.** Needing to weaken a guard is a
sign the tool is enumerating when it should be addressing.

## 7. Standards remain the normative authority

WRL Forge is standards-first. Correctness questions about VRML97 are settled by
**ISO/IEC 14772-1** and the Web3D specifications — never by any single implementation's
behaviour, White Dune's included.

Another implementation can teach *technique*: how to structure a scene tree, what a
field inspector needs, how a ROUTE graph is usefully drawn. It cannot establish what the
language *means*. Where an implementation and the standard disagree, the standard wins
and the divergence is classified as a compatibility item (see [`WD.md`](WD.md) §9).

## 8. Featured artwork and content

Creative content — VRML scenes, models, textures — displayed *by* WRL Forge or featured
on the project website is **not** covered by the software license. See
[`FEATURED_CONTENT_POLICY.md`](FEATURED_CONTENT_POLICY.md).

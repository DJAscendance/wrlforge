//   // result: { tree, tokens, comments, diagnostics, defs, routes, uses,

//
// Pure: text in, tree + diagnostics + index out. Gzip is handled OUTSIDE the
// parser (the main process decompresses to plain UTF-8 first; see
// src/preview/wrl-source.js). `profile` is carried through for later Mall vs.
// World rule layering but does NOT change syntax parsing in 7A -- the tree is
// profile-neutral by design.

//
// NARROWED ON PURPOSE. Both modules export more than appears here: internal

// 4.9.3 is a statement about a document and not about a filesystem -- it takes a
// parse result and a written fragment, and it has never heard of a URL, a base
// document, an archive root or a retrieval. The Node-side orchestration that
// walks a candidate list and recurses across documents is `src/proto-resolution/`
// and is deliberately NOT reachable from this facade.

// two DOCUMENTS, not about a filesystem: it takes two scope graphs and two
// declarations, and it has never heard of a URL, a base document, an archive or
// a retrieval. The Node-side orchestration that consumes WD1.7-C evidence and

// verdicts the authorities above already froze and answers only "how should a
// consumer show this". It is the one place severity, attention rank, ordering,
// default visibility, filter tags and save policy are decided, so WD2 can
// render a findings list without re-deriving any of them -- and without a
// second, divergent opinion growing inside the editor, the inspector and the
